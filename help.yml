      Welcome to Inclusive Recreation's Minecraft server. 
      The purpose of this project is to promote the social skills necessary for effective community participation. Things like respect for self, others, and shared spaces; consideration; cooperation; and leadership. 
      In order to practice those skills, people need to interact with others. To encourage that, the game is designed to be harder for those that play solo.
